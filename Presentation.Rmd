# Introduction

## Myself 
- Fan of open source software
- Bachelor in Computer Science and Biology at McGill
- Started using R after learning Java and Python
> - Discovered RMarkdown and knitr \
`r include_graphics("Introduction/Brain.png")`

<div class="notes">
- R was very confusing
- Different ways to access dataframes versus lists versus matrixes. 
- Not one good way to do object oriented programming. 
- Apply functions instead of for loops.
</div>

## Why have a good workflow?
> - Keep a clean workspace and focus on one thing at a time \
`r include_graphics("Introduction/Desk.jpg")`
> - Make collaboration and sharing work easier

# Project Management

## Basics

<div class="columns-2">
`r include_graphics("Project/Structure.png")`

- Keep project in one folder
- Keep raw data folder read-only
- Different folder treated data
- Avoid duplicating code
- One folder for functions
- One folder for anlysis scripts
- Folders for output, plots, text documents

</div>

## In RStudio

- Use RStudio Projects \
`r include_graphics("Project/rstudio.png")`
- ProjectTemplate package

# Version Control

## Confusing and messy filenames
```{r }
include_graphics("Version control/Filenames.gif")
```

## Better alternatives 
> - Informative filenames
> - Periodically archiving the whole project (eg: zip)
> - Many cloud based serices (also serves as backup) \
```{r}
include_graphics("Version control/Dropbox.png")
cat("\t\t\t")
include_graphics("Version control/Drive.png")
cat("\t")
include_graphics("Version control/OneDrive.png")
```

## Best alternative 
- Use software designed for version control
- Git or SVN
> - Alows you to keep track of *key* changes
> - Makes you fearless
> - Works with GitHub for easy collaboration and cloud backup
> - Supported in RStudio

## Git basics

`r include_graphics("Version control/git-transport.png") `

# Generating Reproducible Documents
<div class="notes">
These slides were generated entirely in RStudio. \
I did not open PowerPoint, or Google Slides even once.
</div>

## R Markdown

- Simple formatting syntax for HTML, PDF and MS Word
- Integrate "chunks" of R code to include code, plots, and tables

## Displaying code output
```{r, echo=TRUE}
print("Hello World!")
```

```{r cars, echo=TRUE}
pander(head(cars), col.names = c("Speed (&mu;m/h)", "Distance Travelled (&mu;m)"))
```

## Plots

```{r plot, fig.height=5*0.9, fig.width=7*0.9, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2); library(cowplot)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width)) + geom_point()
```

## And Reporting Test Results

```{r echo=TRUE}
fit <- lm(dist~speed, data=cars)
pander(summary(fit))
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
