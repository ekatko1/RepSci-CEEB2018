# Version Control

## Confusing and messy filenames
```{r }
include_graphics("Version control/Filenames.gif")
```


## Better alternatives 
> - Informative filenames
> - Periodically archiving the whole project (eg: zip)
> - Many cloud based serices (also serves as backup)

    `r include_graphics("Version control/Dropbox.png")`
    `r include_graphics("Version control/Drive.png")`
    `r include_graphics("Version control/OneDrive.png")`


## Best: use Git (or SVN)
> - Software designed for version control
> - Alows you to keep track of *key* changes
> - Makes you fearless
> - Works with GitHub for easy collaboration and cloud backup
> - Works with RStudio Projects

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
